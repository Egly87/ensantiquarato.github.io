Canva import instructions & notes
--------------------------------

Files created in `assets/brand/` and `assets/templates/` are vector SVG templates you can import directly into Canva (or use as reference).

How to import into Canva:
1. Open Canva and create a new design with the target size (or choose "Custom size").
2. Upload the SVG files from `assets/brand/` or `assets/templates/` (drag & drop into Uploads).
3. Once uploaded, drag the SVG onto the canvas. You can resize, change colors, and add text overlays.
4. Export from Canva as WebP/JPG/PNG as required.

Notes:
- SVGs are vector: in Canva you can change colors and scale without quality loss.
- If your Canva account doesn't accept SVG, open the SVG in a browser, right-click and "Save image as..." PNG then upload PNG instead.
- For favicon PNG: open `assets/brand/favicon.svg` in a browser and export to PNG 512x512 using Preview or an online converter.

Files created (paths):
- `assets/brand/logo.svg`
- `assets/brand/logo-horizontal.svg`
- `assets/brand/favicon.svg`
- `assets/brand/og-1200x630.svg`
- `assets/brand/hero-1920x1080.svg`
- `assets/templates/template-4x3-1600x1200.svg`
- `assets/templates/template-1x1-1600x1600.svg`

If you want, I can also:
- export PNG/JPG versions here (but quality and formats are better controlled inside Canva), or
- convert SVG->PNG for favicon/og here and add them to the repo.
