# Project Requirements (Non-Negotiables)

## Mobile-First (Smartphone)
- Every page must work well at **360px width** (typical smartphone).
- No horizontal scrolling, readable typography, and large tap targets (buttons/links/inputs).
- Marketplace flows must be usable with one hand: search, filters, favorites, product detail, and contact.

## Friendly UX
- Simple language, clear CTAs, and consistent labels.
- Accessibility basics: keyboard focus, sensible headings, and good contrast.
- Fast loading: optimize images (WebP where possible) and avoid heavy scripts.
